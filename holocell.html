                            program is a 16 week internship, where interns are typically put in a group of seven &mdash;
                            five developers, one designer, one PM &mdash; to focus on a single project. Garage is a very
                            unique internship because the intern team is driving the project: coming up with a vision,
                            deciding on features, organizing sponsor meetings, planning sprints, all with limited supervision
                            from our manager and our coaches.

                            Most of these projects start from scratch, but my team had the unique opportunity to
                            continue a project that was started by a previous intern group.

                            The project that we started on (<a href=https://youtu.be/4OouJKwl5bM target = "_blank">video summary here</a>)
                            already had the major components of our app: the processing
                            and rendering of the 50,000 cells, different modes to explore different aspects of the data, and the
                            beginnings of a companion web application.
                            When my intern group started, we reassessed the state of
                            the project with our sponsors, and decided on the three key features we wanted to add.<br><br>

                                One of the major benefits of HoloLens over other 3D imaging platforms is how
                                intuitive it is to interact with. To take advantage of this, we wanted to add the ability to use

                                Our goal was the integrate the Sticky Notes API into our app
                                so that researchers could place holographic notes and access them from anywhere.

                                Our most important goal was to find a way to integrate our application
                                into a cancer researcher's workflow. We decided to focus on
                                <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target = "_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>
                                since it is one of the most widely used tools for data analysis.

                            Besides the three goals listed above, one general goal we had was to increase
                            the functionality of the companion web
                            app. While the HoloLens is great at visualizing and interacting with data, it has
                            limitations for small, precise actions. We assessed all the features we had and
                            the new features we wanted to implement, and delegated aspects of them to either the
                            HoloLens app or the web app based on which was more suitable.

                            We also wanted to implement some sort of saved state, so that researchers would be
                            able to make some observations, and come back to the same sticky notes, same cell
                            model orientation, etc. to continue observing or to share with a fellow researcher.

                            By the end of the four months, my team had integrated gestures, created a Python API for
                            Jupyter Notebook, and added the idea of sessions to the app. While we had implemented a
                            way for researchers to annotate the cell model using a version of sticky notes, we were
                            not able to integrate the Microsoft Sticky Notes API due to issues with authentication.
                            <br><br>Some of the gestures we implemented included:

                            Our Python API enabled researchers to push cell groups &mdash; the name of the group and a
                            list of cells that belong to that group &mdash; to the app at runtime. This feature
                            allowed the most flexibility to the researcher: for example, if they wanted to see all the
                            cell types in the app, they could push a list of cells for each cell type.

                            Both the HoloLens web app components were developed using <a href="https://unity3d.com/">
                            Unity</a>, with C# as the primary language. The web app and HoloLens communicated using
                            <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/pun" target="_blank">Photon</a> as a networking
                            framework, and all the cell data and session data was stored in Azure.
                            Our Jupyter Notebook API was written in Python.

                            My most important development contribution was to the Jupyter Notebook integration.
                            After various user testing sessions with reseachers, I understood what their vision was
                            and took the lead on creating a plan to integrate it into our application. This involved
                            a very thorough understanding of the entire codebase, since this feature needed to fit within
                            the constraints of the features we already had.
                            With this plan, my team was able to finish the basis of this feature ahead of schedule.

                            In addition to being a developer, my unique role on the team was the UX champion. I worked closely
                            with our designer to implement designs into both components of the application,
                            and evaluated how the design aligned with the functionality. I was the primary
                            contributor to the web application interface, and also implemented various aspects of
                            the HoloLens interface.

                            I learned so much more than I expected to during this internship. Tons of soft skills: our first three weeks were dedicated to planning, organizing, creating and presenting a vision. The importance of working in a team: I learned very quickly to rely on my teammates and ask for help when I needed it. Time management and prioritization: throughout the internship, we struggled with having too much we wanted to do and not enough time to do it. We had to cut a couple features which was difficult to do, but we were able to implement the core features that would make our app useful to a researcher. From my development work, I experienced many times that the core part of a feature usually doesn’t take much time to implement, but figuring out all the small bugs and end cases that result is time-consuming and not worth getting sidetracked by in the initial stages of implementation.
