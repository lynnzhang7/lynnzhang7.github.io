                        Hello there! My name is Koen Yi and I am corporate lawyer in Toronto with a passion for
                        visual arts. My artistic endeavours are predominately impressionist. I use a variety of
                        media ranging from charcoal to liquid white-out to acrylic paints.
                        <br><br>My long-term goal is to become a mixed-media impressionist artist.

                                <div class="content"><strong>Why mixed-media?</strong></div>

                                    A few years back, I started challenging the convention that a composition
                                    should consist of a single medium. Why pigeonhole yourself by exclusively
                                    using one type of paint? Watercolour is light and transparent. Oils are heavy
                                    and opaque. In a given image, there are parts that demand transparency and
                                    others that demand layers. In a landscape painting, I would use watercolour
                                    to push objects in the background further into the distance and then oils to
                                    bring attention to the foreground. In this way, further depth can be manufactured
                                    by bringing together the unique offerings of each type of paint. I have
                                    experimented on the grayscale by using a mix of pencil smudging, liquid white-up
                                    and charcoal.

                                    My philosophy of art has always been centrist. If we consider abstract
                                    expressionism one end of the spectrum and pure academia the other, I fall
                                    somewhere in the middle. In other words, while I believe that technical
                                    aestheticism is an inherent metric of art, I also believe that the artist’s
                                    function is not that of a camera. A great artist expresses in an image
                                    something unobservable in objective reality—the subject perspective of the
                                    artist himself. Impressionism embodies this philosophy perfectly: it is not
                                    completely divorced from objective reality as the subject matter is of objective
                                    reality, but it is imputed with the distinctive stylistic elements that depict
                                    the artist’s state of mind.

                        I have been trained in academic sketching for several years prior to graduating secondary
                        school in 2009. In grade 8, I enrolled in the Byng Arts Mini School, a program dedicated
                        to development of the fine arts. I won the award for visual arts for my year in grade 9,
                        and then the same award in the International Baccalaureate program when I transferred in
                        grade 10. During this time, I also participated in several national visual art contests,
                        such as the Royal Canadian Legion Art contest. I am currently a hobbyist and enjoy painting
                        in my spare time.
