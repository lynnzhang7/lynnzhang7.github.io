                                to calculate the property tax index for the
                                consumer price index, which is used to calculate many various federal statistics,
                                including Canada’s inflation rate.

                            My internship position at Statistics Canada was as a systems development programmer.
                            Throughout the internship, I was assigned various tasks by my manager, but my main
                            responsibility was to develop the Reference Tables section of our application.

                        <p class="content">
                            The Reference Tables section was where users would find information about Canada’s
                            provinces, cities, municipalities, and strata, such as population distribution and
                            average housing prices. I implemented the full stack of this feature: developing the
                            user interface using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/"
                            target="_blank">Windows Forms</a> and C#, manipulating the PTAX database using SQL
                            queries and stored procedures, and following the <a href="https://cslanet.com/" target="_blank">CSLA</a>
                            design pattern to connect the UI with the back-end.

                            This was the first tech internship I’ve done, and I learned a few key general lessons
                            about how work is different from school during the four months.
                        </p>

                                <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> our client had created a 40 page document of requirements and use-cases,
                                    modified from the old PTAX application. Even so, there were still many ambiguities
                                    that needed to be resolved. I learned to expect these ambiguities and  to resolve
                                    them efficiently.</li>
                                <li><strong>Other people’s code:</strong> I learned very quickly in this internship that I would not be
                                    writing a lot of my own code. I spent my first three weeks reading documentation and
                                    the codebase and trying to understand all the different classes and what they were
                                    used for: it was the first time I had seen such an extensive framework and it was
                                    very overwhelming. I needed to become comfortable with the framework in order to
                                    implement my various features, and I found the best way to do so was to jump in
                                    and try coding something, rather than reading the documentation word for word.</li>
                                <li><strong>Don’t break the build:</strong> I broke the build twice during my internship, and both times
                                    caused a lot of stress and commotion for my team. I learned very quickly to carefully
                                    check my code before I pushed it.</li>
